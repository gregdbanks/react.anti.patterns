## Ignoring Component Lifecycles.

Imagine you've got a component that fetches some data when it mounts. But, you just jump straight into fetching without thinking about what happens when the component unmounts.

```jsx
function IgnorantComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await response.json();
      setData(data);
    };

    fetchData();
  }, []);

  // Rest of the component...
}
```

This looks fine, but what happens if your component unmounts before the fetch is complete? Kaboom! You get an error because you're trying to call setData on an unmounted component. This is like trying to deliver a pizza to a house that's just been bulldozed. Not gonna work!

To avoid this, you can use a cleanup function in your useEffect hook to prevent the state update on an unmounted component:

```jsx
function WiseComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    let isMounted = true; // This will track if the component is still mounted

    const fetchData = async () => {
      const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
      const data = await response.json();

      if (isMounted) {
        setData(data); // Only update state if the component is still mounted
      }
    };

    fetchData();

    return () => {
      isMounted = false; // Cleanup: Set isMounted to false when the component unmounts
    };
  }, []);

  // Rest of the component...
}
```

Now, when your component unmounts, you won't get an error if the fetch hasn't completed. It's like cancelling the pizza delivery when the house gets bulldozed. The pizza guy thanks you!
